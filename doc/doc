Olloj is the serializer
OllojContainer is a generic OllojSerializeable object that can be named, and be given other OllojSerializeable objects as members to hold
OllojPair is a pair between a OllojSerializable object and its String name
OllojSerializable is just an interface that allows a class to work with all of the Olloj methods
OllojStructure is the interface that the user can use to interact with strings created by the serializer, and therefore deserialize the structure into Strings, generally passed in as constructor methods to objects

The other files in this project are for either testing, or demonstration purposes

This is an example of a structure generated by the Olloj Serializer

<Dog>
	<Age>5</Age>
	<Name>Faker</Name>
	<Cat>
		<Age>200</Age>
		<Name>Muffins</Name>
	</Cat>
	<Box>
		<Toy>Ball</Toy>
		<Toy>Stick</Toy>
		<Toy>Sqeaky Ball</Toy>
		<Toy>Chips</Toy>
	</Box>
</Dog>

In order to generate this, each object must implement the OllojSerializeable interface

In order to deserialize the objects from a String input like above, each object being deserialized must implement a constructor that takes an OllojStructure as its parameter.
The OllojStructure serves as an interface with the structure, formatted as a String like above.

OllojStructure Strings
OllojStructure -> <StructureName>OllojStructure[]</StructureName> | <StructureName>String</StructureName>
